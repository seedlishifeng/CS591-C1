1. How to run my code
	Go to the folder and just type python3 main.py in command line. It may take 3-5 minutes to show a quick demo.

2. There are two parameter can be tuned in my code, they are "demo" and "trained_yet"
	if demo is true, my code will give a quick demo like the result in my report.
		otherwise, my code will test all my samples and give an accuracy of my code.
	if trained_yet is true, my code will load the data which I trained before and test my code's accuracy
		otherwise, my code will train the raw data which will cost extra 3 minutes
